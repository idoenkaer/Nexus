        content: `A crumpled manifest, stained with salt water and what looks like blood. It details a series of transactions through the city's old, forgotten subway tunnels.

Key points:
- Entry point: Underneath the old butchery district.
- Primary contraband: Arcane reagents, 'cleaned' weaponry.
- Key figure: A lieutenant known only as 'The Conductor'. He's said to have an affinity for old music boxes.
- Weakness: The manifests mention periodic, unscheduled stops due to 'vermin' problems in the deeper tunnels. A potential point of ambush.`
